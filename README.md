# Learning about Version Control

Author: Sifan Zhang

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

What I like most about version control:
  Version control enables more than one developers to work on the same project simultaneously. With branch and merge capabilities, team members can work on separate branches and then merge changes into the main branch, reducing conflicts and improving collaboration

What I find most challenging/confusing/frustrating about version control: 
  I don't have much experience using version control, so I am still getting used to it and trying to be familiar with the whole process.
